Parallelizing a text editor

Imagine the following scenario: 

An upcoming startup wants to revolutionize a text editor. They have an early version of their text editor ready, but want to make this editor ultra-fast by making it parallel. You are hired as the parallel programming expert to help them implement this, and take it forward.



Your assignment is to look at the documentation (tutorial) given in the below link, fiddle around on the Github repo given in the tutorial, obtain the source code, and parallelize it using APIs given in the pthreads library. (Feel free to ask for help if you are stuck at any point in time. The instructions for this assignment is intentionally kept minimal in order to simulate the atmosphere of working in an industry.)

There are bonus marks for implementing spell-check into this text editor. Remember, the text editor has to be ultra-fast and should work seamlessly even on huge-files.
